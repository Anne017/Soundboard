Can you help me? I'm a beginner in code, but I want to add the following functions to Soundboard. So do you have (code) ideas? Please open an issue/pull request on GitHub or send me a message on Telegram (@SanderKlootwijk).

To-Do:

* Search (with tags), easily search for sounds.
* Favorites, add sounds to your favorites.
* Hide sounds + hidden sounds page.
* Export sounds (or set them as ringtone).
