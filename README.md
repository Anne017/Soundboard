# Soundboard

Soundboard is a simple soundboard app for Ubuntu Touch.
The sounds are in alphabetical order and you can browse multiple categories.

Important: I've not uploaded the sounds to GitHub because of copyright reasons. So when you're running the project it will chrash because the app can't find the sound files. Whenever you want to try this app out, you can find the sound files in the .click package.

Can you help me? I'm a beginner in code, but I want to add the following functions to Soundboard. So do you have (code) ideas? Please open an issue/pull request on GitHub or send me a message on Telegram (@SanderKlootwijk).

To-Do:

* Search (with tags), easily search for sounds.
* Favorites, add sounds to your favorites.
* Hide sounds + hidden sounds page.
* Export sounds (or set them as ringtone).
